/*
Inheritance use to use and iherit properties and methods to subclasses from one or more super classes.
A subclass inherits all the public and protected members, such as fields and methods, from the superclass. However, it does not inherit the private members.

There are 4 types of inheritances:

1. Single inheritance: allows class to inherit from one super class
2. Multi-level inheritance: allow class to inherit from another class which is also a subclass to a another super class.
3. Hierarchical inheritance: allow muliple classes to iherit from single super class.
4. Multple inhritance: allow class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple super classes.

create each file for each class defined. Its the industrial best practice.

for inherit from a super class we use extend keyword.
